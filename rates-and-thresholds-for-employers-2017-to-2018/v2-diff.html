        <p>The same weekly <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> rate applies to all employees.

        <p>Use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/calculate-statutory-sick-pay"><abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> calculator</a> to work out your employee’s sick pay, or use the rates below.</p>
