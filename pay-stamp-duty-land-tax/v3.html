					<p>From 1 April 2015 <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> no longer applies to land transactions in Scotland. These will be subject to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sdlt-scottish-transactions">Land and Buildings Transaction Tax</a>.</p>
				</div>

				<p><abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> is paid when property is bought or transferred in the UK.</p>

				<p>Payment of <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> shouldn’t be confused with paying either:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-stamp-duty">Stamp Duty</a> on shares bought on a stock transfer form</li>
					<li>
						<a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-stamp-duty-reserve-tax">Stamp Duty Reserve Tax</a> on the paperless purchase of shares</li>
					<li>
						<a rel="external" href="https://www.revenue.scot/land-buildings-transaction-tax">Land and Buildings Transaction Tax</a> for transactions in Scotland</li>
				</ul>

				<p><abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> payments and returns are due within 30 days of the ‘effective’ transaction date. This is usually the date of transaction completion but can be earlier, such as the date:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the purchaser is entitled to take possession of the property</li>
					<li>the first rent payment is due</li>
					<li>of substantial completion - where at least 90% of the payment (or other exchange) is made</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="how-much-time-to-allow">How much time to allow</h2>

				<p>Make sure you pay <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> by the deadline or you may have to pay a penalty and/or interest.</p>

				<p>The time you need to allow depends on how you pay.</p>

				<p>You’ll need your 11-character Unique Transaction Reference Number (<abbr title="Unique Transaction Reference Number">UTRN</abbr>). You’ll find this on your paper return or on your electronic SDLT5 certificate.</p>

				<div class="call-to-action">
					<p>Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.</p>
				</div>

				<p>It is recommended that you make separate payments for each unique <abbr title="Unique Transaction Reference Number">UTRN</abbr>. If you need to make a single payment to cover a number of transactions you should first contact <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/payingHMRC/shipley.htm"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Shipley Accounts Office</a> for further information. Please only contact this team for advice on CHAPS payments.</p>

				<p>Payments by:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Faster Payments (online or telephone banking) usually reach <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> on the same or next day, including weekends and bank holidays</li>
					<li>CHAPS usually reach <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> the same working day if you pay within your bank’s processing times</li>
					<li>Bacs usually take 3 working days</li>

				<p>You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/pay-online/stamp-duty">pay online</a>.</p>

				<p>There is a fee for credit cards.</p>

				<p>From 1 January 2016, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will limit the number of credit and debit card payments you can make to any single tax regime within a given period of time, so that only a reasonable number of payments can be made.</p>

				<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will determine what is reasonable by reference to payment card industry standards and guidance.</p>

				<p>If you’re unable to make full payment by credit/debit card you’ll have to use an alternative payment method.</p>

				<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> may withdraw the facility to pay by credit/debit card from any customer attempting to circumvent this restriction.</p>

				<p>You’ll need your 11-character <abbr title="Unique Transaction Reference Number">UTRN</abbr>. You’ll find this on your paper return or on your electronic SDLT5 certificate.</p>

				<div class="call-to-action">
					<p>Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.</p>
				</div>

				<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will accept your payment on the date you make it and not the date it reaches <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s account, including on bank holidays and weekends.</p>

				<h3 id="at-your-bank-or-building-society">At your bank or building society</h3>

				<p>You can make payment at your own branch by cheque or cash. You’ll need your 11-character <abbr title="Unique Transaction Reference Number">UTRN</abbr>. You’ll find this on your paper return or on your electronic SDLT5 certificate.</p>

				<p>Make sure that you:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>use your own bank branch - or you’ll be charged for the service</li>
					<li>use your <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> payslip if you completed a paper return or use software that requires a payslip that shows the <abbr title="Unique Transaction Reference Number">UTRN</abbr> of your submitted return</li>
					<li>make cheques payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs’ and write your <abbr title="Unique Transaction Reference Number">UTRN</abbr> on the front</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="call-to-action">
					<p>Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.</p>

				<h3 id="at-the-post-office">At the Post Office</h3>

				<div class="call-to-action">
					<p>You can pay at the Post Office by cheque, cash or debit card without charge (subject to a maximum of £10,000).</p>
				</div>

				<p>Make sure that you either use:</p>

					<li>software that requires a payslip that shows the <abbr title="Unique Transaction Reference Number">UTRN</abbr> of your submitted return</li>

				<h3 id="post">By cheque through the post</h3>

				<p>Make your cheque payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs only’ followed by your 11-character <abbr title="Unique Transaction Reference Number">UTRN</abbr>. You’ll find this on your paper return or on your electronic SDLT5 certificate. If you are sending a cheque for more than one <abbr title="Unique Transaction Reference Number">UTRN</abbr> you should send a schedule listing each <abbr title="Unique Transaction Reference Number">UTRN</abbr> against each amount.</p>

				<p>If you filed a paper return you’ll need to complete the payslip (from the back of the return) and send this with your cheque.</p>

				<p>Don’t fold the cheque or fasten it to other papers.</p>

				<p>You should allow 3 working days for your payment to reach <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>
